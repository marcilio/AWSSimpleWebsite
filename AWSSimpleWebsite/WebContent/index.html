	<h2>AWSSimpleWebsite - Simulate CPU loads on EC2 instances</h2>

	<p>With AWSSimpleWebsite you can simulate CPU loads on EC2
		instances and see your ElasticLoadBalancer and AutoScalingGroups in
		action!</p>

	<p>
	<h3>How does it work?</h3>
	<p>On start-up the LoadGeneratorServlet servlet will randomly
		select a latency value from 100ms to 5000ms. This is the time the
		Servlet will take to respond to a client request. During this time the
		Servlet will sleep for some time and consume CPU for another chunk of
		time. The larger the TPS the larger the latency time used towards CPU
		consumption. At some point you might notice 100% of CPU consumption!
		If not, increase the TPS load on the client side.</p>

	<h3>AWS ElasticLoadBalancer in Action</h3>

	<p>
		Write a script to load the LoadGeneratorServlet servlet and produce
		TPS or use the <a
			href="https://github.com/marcilio/AWSSimpleWebsiteLoadGenerator">AWSSimpleWebsiteLoadGenerator</a>
		tool for that purpose. While load is being generated open your browser
		and hit the link <a href="/AWSSimpleWebsite/LoadGeneratorServlet">/AWSSimpleWebsite/LoadGeneratorServlet</a>.
		If you have multiple EC2 instances in your ASG you'll notice that the
		"#requests processed" value returned by the Servlet will not the same
		for all EC2s (refresh the page a few times). Instead, the higher the
		latency the lower the #requests being directed to that instance. <b>This
		is the ELB in action</b> distributing your requests fairly across your
		EC2 instance!

	</p>

	<h3>AWS AutoScalingGroup in Action</h3>

	<p>
		Create CloudWatch alarms based on CPU usage and use them in your ASG
		scaling policies. Produce a high TPS load against the
		LoadGeneratorServlet servlet and notice a few minutes later (depending
		on your alarm settings) your ASG launching extra instances to keep up
		with the load. Reduce the TPS and notice the ASG scaling down your
		cluster of EC2s. <b>This is the ASG in action</b> automatically
		scaling up and down your group of EC2 instances
	</p>

	<h3>Try to submit a request</h3>

	<p>
		Your can submit a sample request by <a
