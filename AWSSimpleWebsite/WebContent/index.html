<h2>AWSSimpleWebsite - Observe your Elastic Load Balancer in action and test Auto-Scaling Group policies!</h2>

<p>Point your load tester to http://[service-URL]/AWSSimpleWebsite/LoadGeneratorServlet and have it push lots of requests concurrently. 
Notice CPU consumption of EC2 instances going up. Set up CloudWatch alarms based on CPU consumption and attach them to your Auto-Scaling Groups.
As TPS increases and CPU consumption raises you'll notice new EC2 instances being launched to handle the load. 

<ul>
<li>Test your ASG policies: the higher the TPS the higher the CPU load!</li>
<li>Observe your ELB in action: each instance will start with (and stick to) a random latency which will allow you to see your ELB distributing the load unevenly across instances.</li>
</ul>
